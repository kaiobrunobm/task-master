# task-master

task-master is a simple Node.js/Express REST API application for managing a todo list, powered by PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Quickly create new todo tasks via REST API.
- **Remove tasks**: Delete tasks by their ID.
- **Complete tasks**: (Coming soon) Mark tasks as completed.
- **List tasks**: Retrieve all your tasks, along with their completion status and IDs.
- Tasks are persisted in a PostgreSQL database, using Prisma as the ORM.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (locally or via cloud)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaiobrunobm/task-master.git
   cd task-master
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your `.env` file:**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database credentials:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
   SERVER_PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Generate the Prisma client:**
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

5. **Apply database migrations (if needed):**
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

### Usage

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the server runs on port 3000 (or the port set in your `.env`).

```

```

#### Add a Task

```

```

## File Structure

- `index.js`: Entry point for the REST API server.
- `lib/prisma.js`: Prisma client and database connection logic.
- `prisma/schema.prisma`: Prisma database schema (models, datasource).
- `.env`: Configuration for database connection (not committed to version control).

## Notes

- Each task has a unique integer ID generated by the database.
- Completed task updates and delete endpoint coming soon.
- All data is stored and retrieved directly from a PostgreSQL database.
